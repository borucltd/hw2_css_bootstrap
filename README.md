# 02 HTML CSS Bootstrap

Project objecitves are to use Bootstrap and some customized CSS in order to create simple portfolio.
The main requirement is that it must be responive and looks nice on mobile :)

## How this happened

```
Took a lot of time to make it, mostly due to constantly changing ideas.
Skipping between bootstrap pre-defined styles is difficult as most of them require very detailed reading about the styles and their parameters.
```

## What was done

```
After a few days of playing with different "ready-to-use" bootstrap idea I decided to go with the basic grid layout and make it responsive. I tired not to use too much customized CSS. The website is simple and definitely has some things to be improved. Overall it was a good experience which let me understand responsive layout, viewports and breakpoints.
```

## What next?

As the work follows, I will try to use this project and develop.
